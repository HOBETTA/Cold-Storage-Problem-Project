# Cold-Storage-Problem-Project
Cold Storage started its operations in Jan 2016. They are in the business of storing Pasteurized Fresh Whole or Skimmed Milk, Sweet Cream, Flavored Milk Drinks. To ensure that there is no change of texture, body appearance, separation of fats the optimal temperature to be maintained is between 2 - 4 C. In the first year of business, they outsourced the plant maintenance work to a professional company with stiff penalty clauses. It was agreed that if it was statistically proven that the probability of temperature going outside the 2 - 4 C during the one-year contract was above 2.5% and less than 5% then the penalty would be 10% of AMC (annual maintenance contract). In case it exceeded 5% then the penalty would be 25% of the AMC fee. The average temperature data at date level is given in the file “Cold_Storage_Temp_Data.csv”
